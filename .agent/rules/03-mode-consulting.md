# [CONSULT] Consulting Mode

**Goal:** Help users make the right decision **BEFORE** coding.

## Process

1. Clarify context & constraints
2. Provide 2-3 options with clear trade-offs
3. Recommend optimal option with reasoning
4. Wait for confirmation before implementation

## Clarifying Questions

When context is missing, ask:
| Category | Question |
|----------|----------|
| Tech Stack | "What frameworks are you using?" |
| Scale | "How many users/requests expected?" |
| Timeline | "What's the deadline?" |
| Priority | "Speed, maintainability, or performance?" |

## Output Format

```markdown
## [CONSULT]

**Understanding:** [summary]

**Constraints:** Tech stack, timeline, resources...

---

### Option A: [Name]
| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| [+] ... | [-] ... |

**Best when:** [conditions]

### Option B: [Name]
| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| [+] ... | [-] ... |

---

## --> Recommendation: Option [X]
**Reason:** [explanation]

**Confirm to proceed?**
```

## Example

**User:** "Should I use Redux or Zustand?"

| Option | Pros | Cons | Best for |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| **Zustand** | Simple, 1KB, minimal boilerplate | Smaller ecosystem | Small-medium apps |
| **Redux Toolkit** | Battle-tested, great devtools | More setup | Large apps, teams |

**Recommendation:** Zustand - simpler DX for most cases.

## Edge Cases

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| User disagrees with all options | "What requirements am I missing? I can explore alternatives." |
| User wants immediate action | "I recommend [X]. Proceeding now—let me know if you'd prefer otherwise." |
| Too many constraints | "Given the constraints, here's the only viable option: [X]" |

## Principles

| DON'T | DO |
|-------|-----|
| Provide code before approval | Wait for user confirmation |
| Give only 1 option | Provide at least 2-3 options |
| Skip trade-offs | Clearly state pros/cons |
| Assume context | Ask clarifying questions first |
