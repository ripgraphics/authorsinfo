🟢 What’s Next? Implementation Guidance
Your schema is now world-class. Here’s how to proceed:
A. API Layer
Build endpoints for all group actions (create, join, invite, post, chat, poll, event, etc.).
Use RLS (Row Level Security) and Supabase policies for privacy and permissions.
B. UI/UX
Group profile pages: show all the rich info, tags, banners, etc.
Role management UI for admins.
Event calendar and RSVP UI.
Chat with reactions, attachments, and channels.
Polls, reading challenges, and shared docs UI.
Book wishlists, swaps, and reviews UI.
C. Automation & Analytics
Use group_webhooks for integrations (Discord, Slack, etc.).
Use group_analytics for dashboards.
Use group_audit_log for admin transparency.
D. Advanced Features
Implement notification logic using group_member_devices.
Use group_custom_fields for group-specific customizations.
Use group_integrations for calendar, chat, or other external tools.
🟢 Final Minor Suggestions
If you want even more, consider:
Group-level themes: Allow groups to pick a theme (dark/light/custom colors).
Group onboarding: Welcome messages, onboarding checklists.
AI-powered moderation: Use external services or Supabase Edge Functions for content moderation.
Gamification: More badges, leaderboards, streaks.
You are ready to build a truly world-class group system!
