      "synopsis": "From the author of Broken Country, a captivating drama about how one man’s quest to uncover the truth about his adoption changes everything he knows about love, loss, and the unbreakable bonds of family.<br/><br/>Luke and Hannah live a happy and stable life in London, working in jobs they love as they prepare for the arrival of their first child, Samuel. All his life, Luke has known he was adopted, but he’s never felt the need to seek out his birth mother—until he becomes a father himself.<br/><br/>Spurred by the connection he feels to his son, Luke’s search leads him to his birth mother Alice. Their first encounter is surreal, a sharp prick that barely scratches the surface of a painful past that neither of them has fully confronted.<br/><br/>Alice sinks into memories of her life as a young artist in 1970s London, and of her tragic whirlwind romance with an enigmatic musician who would become Luke’s father. Meanwhile, Luke spirals as he comes face to face with his feelings of abandonment that he worked so hard to bury. But at least Alice seems keen to make up for lost time by looking after Samuel—until her doting grandmother act takes a sinister turn for the worse.<br/><br/>As the truth of who Alice is and the story behind her heartbreaking decision to give up her baby come to light, she and Luke must reckon with the sacrifices they’ve made in the pursuit of love and belonging.",

      "synopsis": "How did a young Parisian mother, celebrated for her beauty and glamour, come to lead the largest spy network in occupied France?<br/><br/>Morocco, 1928. Marie-Madeleine Méric is not the kind of woman who stays quietly at her husband’s side. Polyglot, pianist, and pilot, she is a woman of many skills, with unconventional interests—like driving in car rallies—that earn her a daredevil reputation. But dabbling in intelligence work to assist her military officer husband and the French government helps her recognize who she is at heart: an adventurer.<br/><br/>Paris, 1936. As Europe teeters on the brink of war, Marie-Madeleine is living in France, her marriage now in shambles, when a chance encounter with an enigmatic spy turns her life upside down. He recruits her to help build a resistance network, and she conceals her identity—and gender—as she navigates a perilous double life.<br/><br/>Eventually, she steps into the role of leader of what is now known as Alliance, despite the naysayers who doubt in a woman’s ability to do so. Capture and death are only a heartbeat away for both Marie-Madeleine and the agents under her care. At the helm of Alliance, she achieves seemingly impossible feats of espionage that help turn the tide of the war. But the most impossible, and dangerous, feat of them all? Falling in love.<br/><br/>New York Times bestselling author Natasha Lester beautifully brings Marie-Madeleine Méric Fourcade’s story to life in this powerful, heartbreaking tale of resilience that reminds us what it means to cherish those we love and fight for them with every breath.",

When her mother becomes gravely ill, Alma discovers a clue about her estranged father and writes a message begging for help. Little does she know that she is a bastard of House Avera, one of the four noble families that serve the gods and are imbued with their powers—and her father is a vessel of the Dread Beast, the most frightening god of all, a harbinger of death.<br/>In a desperate exchange for her mother’s medicine, Alma agrees to sacrifice her left arm to the Beast in a ceremony that will bind her forever to the House and its deity. Regardless, her mother soon passes, leaving Alma trapped inside the Avera’s grand estate, despised by her relatives and nothing but a pawn in her father’s schemes.<br/>Now vengeance is the only thing that keeps Alma going. That, and the strange connection she has with her god—a monster who is constantly by her side, an eldritch being taking the form of a beautiful prince with starlit hair that only she can see. He tells Alma that she has been chosen to bring change upon their world, and with his help, Alma plots a perilous journey to destroy the House that stole everything from her.<br/>A gripping fantasy novel marked by divine rituals, intense combat, and twisted romance, House of the Beast is a tale of revenge, resilience, and the power of love to see us through the darkness.",

Ranulf, Robbert, Emeric, Lythian, and many others will play their part. Whether they know it or not, all are pieces of a bigger puzzle, threads of a tapestry weaved through time. There will be tragedy. There will be sacrifice. There will be moments when all seems lost.<br/><br/>Yet the night is darkest just before the dawn. And they must work together to bring the light.",

But the back gate was open, and anyone could have walked in. Did she even know her assailant?<br/><br/>Secrets and lies flourished around this troubled teenager, a thicket of thorns Slider and his team must cut through to find the truth. Who killed Rhianne?<br/><br/>As Slider’s boss says, it’s always the first person you suspect. Except when it isn’t.<br/><br/>This critically-acclaimed British police procedural series is a great choice for fans of Catherine Aird, Ann Cleeves and Peter James.

      "synopsis": "From a rising literary star and the author of how to be a good girl comes a brilliant, biting, and beautifully wrought memoir of trauma and the cost of survival<br/><br/>\"Hood descends into the terrifying dark of the unsayable with the dimmest of flashlights and returns bearing verbal gems, treasures, and marvels. Trauma Plot is a glass case of such wonders.\"—Torrey Peters, bestselling author of Detransition, Baby<br/><br/>In the thick of lockdown, 2020, poet, critic, and memoirist Jamie Hood published her debut, how to be a good girl, an interrogation of modern femininity and the narratives of love, desire, and violence yoked to it. The Rumpus praised Hood’s “bold vulnerability,” and Vogue named it a Best Book of 2020.<br/><br/>In Trauma Plot, Hood draws on disparate literary forms to tell the story that lurked in good girl’s margins—of three decades marred by sexual violence and the wreckage left behind. With her trademark critical remove, Hood interrogates the archetype of the rape survivor, who must perform penitence long after living through the unthinkable, invoking some of art’s most infamous women to have played the role: Ovid’s Philomela, David Lynch’s Laura Palmer, and Artemisia Gentileschi, who captured Judith’s wrath. In so doing, she asks: What do we as a culture demand of survivors? And what do survivors, in turn, owe a world that has abandoned them?<br/><br/>Trauma Plot is a scalding work of personal and literary criticism. It is a send-up of our culture's pious disdain for “trauma porn,” a dirge for the broken promises of #MeToo, and a paean to finding life after death.",

It’s our job to keep people safe and secure.<br/><br/>We’re the monster hunters.<br/><br/>When I get a panicked call from my childhood friend, Greer Baird, my usual cool goes out the window.<br/><br/>Greer’s an engineer working on a huge dam project that’s vital to our water supply.

Enter Gansey, a rich student from Aglionby, the town’s all-boys private school teeming with wealth, privilege, and trouble.

She jumps at the chance to finally be a part of something real and full of magic, a world she was born into yet one that always stood just out of reach. Soon enough, she’s swept into a strange and shifting world woven into theirs, one far more dangerous than anything they could have dreamt up.<br/><br/>Now reimagined as a stunning full-color graphic novel adapted by Stephanie Williams and illustrated by Sas Milledge, The Raven Boys unravels a thrilling plot around a cast of characters impossible to forget.",

I am the Go-Between.<br/><br/>When a young woman from Tokyo contacts the Go-Between to request a meeting with a deceased TV star who once helped her, she doesn’t expect a teenage boy to show up. Dressed in a designer duffel coat and carrying a tattered notebook, Ayumi Shibuya, our mysterious intermediary, offers an extraordinary service: he reunites the living with their dearly departed. Meeting his clients at a luxury hotel, Ayumi lays down the ground rules: each reunion is a one-time arrangement that the dead can refuse; the service is entirely free, and the meeting must take place during a full moon.<br/><br/>As Ayumi arranges these reunions, we encounter a resentful eldest son who wants to ask his mother to unearth the deeds to a plot of land; a teenage girl who blames herself for her best friend’s death; and a weary businessman seeking answers about his fiancée’s disappearance days after he proposed. With each rendezvous, clues begin to surface, leading readers to unravel the mystery of the boy in the duffel coat, whose own story is eventually revealed.<br/><br/>A runaway, multimillion copy bestseller in Japan, Lost Souls Meet Under a Full Moon is storytelling at its finest, from an international sensation whose work has been hailed as “strange and beautiful” (The Guardian). With an artful balance of heart and mystery, Mizuki Tsujimura creates an unforgettable page-turner in which the living and the dead are given one last chance for closure.",

      "synopsis": "Artorius and his team must race against time to thwart a looming clash between two ancient powers, navigating a treacherous landscape where their actions could rewrite history and spark a catastrophic conflict.<br/><br/>In a world where history can be rewritten at will, the threads of destiny intertwine in ways no one could have foreseen.<br/><br/>Years after their groundbreaking journey into the past, Artorius and his team stumble upon a devastating revelation: the Chinese government has dispatched five time-travelers and a trove of advanced technology back to 165 CE, during the waning days of the Han dynasty. While believed they were guiding Rome toward a new era of modernization and unity, the emergence of Chinese influence threatens to unravel everything they have fought for.<br/><br/>As whispers of innovation ripple through the ancient world, Artorius and his companions realize they are in a race against time—not just to protect their vision for a united future, but to prevent a catastrophic clash that could bring about nuclear war centuries sooner than they ever imagined.<br/><br/>With their own presence now at risk of exposure, they must navigate the treacherous waters of politics, technology, and culture in a world caught between two colossal powers. As the balance of history teeters on a knife's edge, loyalties will be tested, alliances forged, and the very fabric of fate will hang in the balance.",

      "synopsis": "Yiyun Li’s remarkable, defiant work of radical acceptance as she considers the loss of her son James.<br/><br/>“There is no good way to say this,” Yiyun Li writes at the beginning of this book.<br/><br/>“There is no good way to state these facts, which must be acknowledged. My husband and I had two children and lost them both: Vincent in 2017, at sixteen, James in 2024, at nineteen. Both chose suicide, and both died not far from home.”<br/><br/>There is no good way to say this―because words fall short. It takes only an instant for death to become fact, “a single point in a timeline.” Living now on this single point, Li turns to thinking and reasoning and searching for words that might hold a place for James. Li does what she can: “doing the things that work,” including not just writing but gardening, reading Camus and Wittgenstein, learning the piano, and living thinkingly alongside death.<br/><br/>This is a book for James, but it is not a book about grieving or mourning. As Li writes, “The verb that does not die is to be. Vincent was and is and will always be Vincent. James was and is and will always be James. We were and are and will always be their parents. There is no now and then, now and later, only, now and now and now and now.” Things in Nature Merely Grow is a testament to Li’s indomitable spirit.",

Her eyes shine as she gazes at him lovingly. But I know that he is hiding a secret. A secret that would devastate my daughter…<br/><br/>My son sits across the round oak table, his jaw set as he plays with his food. I catch his eye, pleading with him silently. Not now. Only we know the truth. My husband pulls his beautiful girl in for a hug, and my heart breaks. My happy family is so close to ruin. How much longer can I hold us together?<br/><br/>We’ve all seen the warning signs: Jemma’s unanswered phone calls, the too-charming way Will wormed his way into our family, the dark rumours about just how far he’ll go to get ahead. I hoped Jemma would uncover his secrets and as I look at her now, I wonder if she’s simply playing a part. After all, she’s watched me play my roles of loving daughter, perfect wife and devoted mother for years. Is my daughter more like me than I could ever imagine?<br/><br/>I steel myself. The only way to get Will out of our lives is for me to finally reveal the secret I’ve been keeping. But once the truth is out, will Jemma ever trust me again? Or am I about to lose my darling girl forever?<br/><br/>An utterly gripping and emotional read about the sacrifices we make for those we love.

On the surface, she’s an expert in human behavior and a well-liked educator, but nobody knows she’s a recovering sex addict in therapy—and she needs it to stay that way, or she could lose everything.<br/><br/>But Ethan Wolfe is impossible to resist. The graduate student is brilliant, charming, and seductive as hell. He’s also Sheila’s teaching assistant, and thirteen years her junior. Ignoring the risks, they begin an illicit affair that lasts three months until Sheila finally puts a stop to it.<br/><br/>But Ethan can’t move on so easily—after all, he didn’t pursue his professor for as long as he did without plans of his own. When the body of one of Sheila’s students is discovered floating in Puget Sound—a young woman Ethan was rumored to have dated—it’s clear that the graduate student has secrets of his own. And he’s not about to let Sheila get away.",

As always in this series, the great pleasure is in the intricate interplay of personalities, especially nuanced in Mother Love. Not surprisingly, the book won Wright her second Crime Writers of Canada Award for Best Novel, and was the first mystery ever to win the Canadian Authors’ Association Literary Prize for Fiction.",

Never upstage the bride.<br/><br/>Katie is looking forward to serving from her ice cream truck at a black-tie wedding on a palatial estate in Massachusetts, when an incoming snowstorm suddenly moves up the start time. Thanks to the housekeeping staff, she avoids breaking rule number one. Shortly after the cocktail hour ends, however, she manages to find herself breaking rules two and three at the same time, along with help from an involuntary participant.<br/><br/>The Chadsworth family is thrown into chaos when one of their own is discovered unresponsive beneath a table when they should have been part of the bridal party introductions at the reception. Of course, Katie Thorne, ice cream scooper extraordinaire, is the first to discover not only the body but also the details that keep the suspicious circumstances from getting swept under the dance floor.<br/><br/>What will it take to prevent the unofficial royalty of New England from keeping their bouquet of dirty little secrets to themselves and allow Katie and her friendly feline, Jaspurr, to serve up some justice?",

As More writes of her time growing up as a South Asian woman, to adulthood, she weaves an intricacy of emotions of trying to define ourselves beyond the bounds of familial relations and delves into the ideas of youth and mortality. This coming-of-age book of poetry is a tribute to the women who grew up as first-generation Americans, and the eternal flame of feminine rage. Poems whose voice is a force to be reckoned with and pushes for a solidarity amongst women from all walks of life.",

The Webs of Fate series is an addicting forbidden love, dark romantic fantasy with witty banter, heart-stopping action, and blistering hot romance set in a vibrant modern-day world full of magic where myth and history blur together in a mockery of truth. Callahan<br/>Welcome to the Dark, Little Star.<br/><br/>Natalia saves my life. Mistake or not, it puts her on the board as a player. The Light will hunt her for the betrayal and the Dark will seek her to use her. I sink my claws into Natalia, twisting her into a contract. I have uses for her, and for the Light she carries within her.<br/><br/>The annual Gathering Shadows Ceremonies loom on the horizon, twelve days where I’m forced to compete for the Dark Throne. It’s kill or be killed. I name her as my partner, but she’s a wild card, fighting my authority as her alpha. She’s breathtaking, raw power I’m drawn to, but she might cost me everything.<br/><br/>Natalia<br/>It was an accident.<br/><br/>As a Magia I have two obligations: an arranged betrothal to preserve my Magia bloodline and protect humans from the Seraphinus. I didn’t mean to save the life of a Darkling. In my defense, I was hung over and thought he was human. Oops.<br/><br/>I accept a contract trying to postpone marrying a man I don’t love and unwittingly sell my life to Callahan. He claims to be my alpha now, but it’s stupid to trust a man who admits he wants to use me. He is a Dark Seraphinus, wickedly brutal and lacks remorse. Still, the way he stares at me with hungry desire and holds my hand tempts me, and I’m in more danger than losing my life.<br/><br/>This series contains depictions of graphic violence and adult situations. It is recommended for readers 17+.",

      "synopsis": "Lucas, Dustin, and Mike embark on a high-fantasy adventure with classmate Eddie Munson and his Hellfire Club in this new four-issue mini-series, collected here as a graphic novel!<br/><br/>Spell slinging, sword swinging, and the luck of the dice have shaped the lives of the Stranger Things boys well before they had real monsters to face. This D&D crossover delves into Eddie Munson’s past and his rise to de facto leader of the Hellfire Club, and explores his recruitment of Lucas, Dustin, and Mike. Throughout, there are brilliant glimpses into the fantasy world of Dungeons & Dragons that they explore together. This book highlights what really makes tabletop RPGs great through the lens of the hit Netflix series.<br/><br/>At first, the Mirkwood gang is hesitant to join a new campaign without Will and El, but Eddie conjures up his charm and does his best to inspire them to answer his call to adventure. Reflecting on the legendary campaign that got him hooked, Eddie remembers how the original Hellfire crew navigated the weird social dynamics of Hawkins High, seeking new party members to help take on a vicious manticore that nearly wiped out their party, proving time and time again that the party is always stronger than the individual adventurer.<br/><br/>Rumors about Eddie’s bad reputation make Lucas worry that joining his club might hurt his chances of making the basketball team. But when the dice are cruel, Eddie’s true character shines through, earning all of the boys’ respect. Eddie Munson ushers in a new age for Hawkins High Hellfire Club with an exciting conclusion to Mike, Dustin, and Will’s first big Hellfire Club victory.<br/><br/>An action-packed fantasy love letter to the nerds of the eighties who dared to roll dice before it was cool, written by Jody Houser (Critical Role, Doctor Who) and Eric Campbell (Frank Frazetta’s Dawn Attack), and expertly drawn by Diego Galindo (Stranger Things: Tomb of Ybwen).<br/><br/>Collects Stranger Things and Dungeons & Dragons: The Rise of Hellfire #1–#4.",

Girls raised there are bequeathed strange gifts. A few have powers so dark that they fear to use them. Such a place is Wild Hill, on the tip of Long Island. For centuries, the ghost of a witch murdered by colonists claimed the beautiful and fertile Wild Hill…until a young Scottish woman with strange gifts arrived. Sadie Duncan was allowed to stay.<br/>Five generations of Sadie’s descendants called Wild Hill home, each generation more powerful than the last. Then, in the aftermath of a terrible tragedy, the last of the Duncans, once prophesized to be the most powerful of their kind, abandoned their ancestral home.<br/>One of them, Brigid Laguerre moved to California and turned her dark gift into fame and fortune. Her sister, Phoebe, settled on a ranch in Texas, where women visit in secret for her tonics and cures. Phoebe’s daughter, Sybil, has become a famous chef. Seemingly powerless, Sibyl has never been told of the Duncan bloodline.<br/>Now Brigid, Phoebe, and Sibyl have been brought to Wild Hill to discover their family legacy. The Old One, furious at the path mankind has taken, has chosen three powerful witches to turn the tide. The Duncans will fulfill their destinies—but only if they can set aside their grievances and come together as a family.",

Estleman's next enthralling Amos Walker mystery, Smoke on the Water.<br/><br/>As the smoke from Canadian wildfires chokes Detroit, PI Amos Walker is tasked with investigating a fatal hit-and-run. The victim is Spencer Bennett, a junior law associate with the Waterford Group, and he supposedly had a file of confidential documents on him when he died. But those documents have now gone missing, and the firm is dead set on Walker finding them. As Walker digs deeper into the events leading to Bennett's death, all signs are pointing towards the crash being anything but accidental.<br/><br/>Summer in Detroit was hot enough before the smoke descended, but as the temperature rises and more bodies crop up in connection to the missing file, Walker will have to track down those documents -- and unearth why they were worth killing over -- before it's too late.",

And her only plan is to stop the war with their rival Kingdom Klyeria when she takes the crown. But she has a little secret no one knows about (save one precious soul): she has magical powers that are growing stronger and stronger every day, and they’re getting harder to control.<br/>River, Ember’s personal Royal Guard, has only one duty: keep the princess safe and alive. That would be easy enough if she didn’t make it so damn hard. Cold, stoic, and strict—River seems to want nothing to do with Ember other than being her silent guard. Or does she just not notice all his stolen glances?<br/>Crown Prince Aris of Klyeria has one task: make Ember his future Queen. Seductive, charming, and secretive—Aris turns Ember’s world upside down the moment he steps into it.<br/>With no one to turn to about her powers, Ember is lost and desperate to find answers about who she is, and what she is.<br/>Unravel Ember’s story twisted with lies as she searches for the truth in a world much bigger than she ever knew. A world full of dragons, fairies, and rythars. Love, lust, and lying. And so, so much more.",

When she is approached by Raina, a mysterious, terminally ill woman with a very strange request, Electra finds herself falling for Raina both as a romantic prospect and a specimen.<br/><br/>Things are only complicated further as Electra is plagued by nightmares of an Appalachian cryptid she calls the she-stag. Will Electra be able to fulfill Raina's peculiar wish, or will she succumb to her most violent, carnal urges and sacrifice the biggest job of her life to appease an old god?<br/><br/>“Delightfully strange and full of macabre twists, STUFFED provides readers with an introspective journey into the abject. An unusual request leads to haunting secrets shedding like antler velvet, exposing questions of identity, spirituality, and what it means to be free. From Appalachian gods to eclectic taxidermy, this liminal exploration of the living and the dead holds nothing back.” -Sara Tantlinger, Bram Stoker Award-winning author of The Devil’s Dreamland",

COOPER<br/><br/>A cosmic catastrophe, the Ring of Fire, strands the West Virginia town of Grantville back in time in the middle of the Thirty Years War. One of its ripple effects is that Japan has pulled back from a policy of isolation and staked out its own claims on the west coast of North America. But it is not the only power interested in that part of the New World, and the native Americans have also responded, in different ways, to the unexpected colonists. And there are conflicts among the colonists themselves.<br/><br/>In settling the fate of this part of the New World, a few remarkable individuals have an outsize role to play: Oyamada Isamu, a samurai on his first independent command; Yells-at-Bears, a young native woman of Vancouver Island; Father Blanco, a Jesuit priest and former missionary; and Iroha Data-hime, the daughter of the Grand Governor of New Nippon.",

Diana is engaged in classified work at RAF Hawkinge, including Operation Corona, which recruits German-speaking Women’s Auxiliary Air Force members—many of them Jewish refugees from the Kindertransport rescue—to countermand German orders and direct night fighters away from Allied bombers.<br/><br/>It’s fascinating and critical espionage work, but it’s laced with peril, as Billy finds out. On a scenic Christmas walk along the White Cliffs of Dover, Billy and Diana stumble upon the dead body of a US Air Force officer. In the dead man’s pocket are papers with highly confidential information about radio interception operations. Information worth killing over.<br/><br/>As Billy digs into the secret world of codebreakers and radio jammers stationed at Hawkinge, another body turns up. Now Billy must find out what connects these two men—and who was so hell-bent on silencing them. Enlisting the help of his long-time associates, Billy undertakes another thrilling investigation that brings him to war-torn Yugoslavia, where he must rescue an escaped POW who may be the only person who knows the truth.",

Much wine is drunk as the guests listen, and a delicious meal consumed. Little does anyone gathered around the candlelit table know that for generations to come people will speculate about the message of this poem, a copy of which has never been found, and which remains an enduring mystery.<br/><br/>2119: Just over one hundred years in the future, much of the western world has been submerged by rising seas following a catastrophic nuclear accident. Those who survive are haunted by the richness of the world that has been lost. In the water-logged south of what used to be England, Thomas Metcalfe, a lonely scholar and researcher, longs for the early twenty-first century as he chases the ghost of one poem, ‘A Corona for Vivian’. How wild and full of risk their lives were, thinks Thomas, as he pores over the archives of that distant era, captivated by the freedoms and possibilities of human life at its zenith. When he stumbles across a clue that may lead to the elusive poem’s discovery, a story is revealed of entangled loves and a brutal crime that destroy his assumptions about people he thought he knew intimately well.<br/><br/>What We Can Know is a masterpiece, a fictional tour de force, a love story about both people and the words they leave behind, a literary detective story which reclaims the present from our sense of looming catastrophe and imagines a future world where all is not quite lost.",

Perfect for fans of fantasy books like One Dark Window and A Game of Thrones, as well as readers who love epic fantasy worlds filled with secrets, bargains, and betrayal.<br/><br/>In the Kingdom of Magus, Ophelia Dannan's magic has reawakened, but at dire costs.

There, Ophelia plots to end the centuries-old battle for the throne by unearthing and destroying three elusive primordial relics-but she isn't the only one who seeks them. If the Gray King retrieves the instruments first, the magic-born will rot in endless servitude, and if the relics fall into the Darkwielder's hands, his vengeance may obliterate every mortal.<br/><br/>To save Magus from ruin, Ophelia finds herself making a bargain with a dangerous enemy-one that plunges her into a harrowing game of trust, politics, and dark secrets. To win, she'll have to master her horrifying magic, mend her shattered soul, and decide how far she'll go to shape her fate-or she and her kingdom will be destined for destruction.<br/><br/>In a war between gods and monarchs, one will rise.",

There's more in the woods than meets the eye.<br/><br/>When 13-year-old Eliza Loft learns that high school senior, Renée Pope, was brutally attacked and killed, she's horrified-and she just might be the only one who knows what happened. After all, Eliza was in the woods that night, and what she saw haunts her for years, especially since she can't talk about it with anyone. Not when she knows deep down that a moment of mischief between friends might have been a contributing factor in Renée's death.<br/><br/>But when an anonymous note claiming to know all about her involvement appears in Eliza's locker years later, staying quiet about what happened may no longer be an option. After a co-conspirator with shared responsibility for the prank that led to Renée's death receives an identical message and turns up dead just one day later, Eliza becomes even more panicked. Suddenly, she's convinced that she's being targeted for what she did and must fight to prove what happened before it's too late.<br/><br/>A twisty, unpredictable thriller full of dynamic characters and dark secrets, I Know What I Saw is a gripping coming-of-age story that seamlessly blends elements of paranormal folklore and sasquatch mythology with all the conventions of a spellbinding whodunnit.",

From his beginnings in the hallowed halls of George Eastman’s Kodak laboratories in upstate New York, to war-torn Nazi-occupied France and beyond, Terry traverses the globe for that elusive, truthful photograph—and a chance to win the Pulitzer Prize.<br/>But the quest for fame doesn’t come without a lifetime of cost: Terry’s neglected daughter, thousands of miles away, struggles with their family dynamic and who her father really is. His wife, a model spy extraordinaire, is not the ally she purports to be. And Terry’s lifelong rival and fellow international photographer, Cameron Plumb, presents a constant, unrelenting roadblock to winning the definitive prize.<br/><br/>Set against the backdrop of the many brutal conflicts of the twentieth century, Bobbie Calhoun’s debut novel is a thrilling page-turner, epic in scope and stunningly beautiful in its humanity, asking: How far will these war photographers go to secure their place for all time, and what price are they willing to pay for the ultimate prize?",

As he approaches adulthood, he has friends, a future...a family.<br/><br/>Then, late one stormy night, a group of men arrive at their door, one of whom is badly wounded, occult symbols carved into his flesh.

Rosie Killeen crosses the road that divides her family’s County Mayo farm from the estate of Lord and Lady Ennis, and makes her way to the “big house” for the first time. Barely eight years old, Rosie joins the throng of servants preparing for the arrival of Queen Victoria. But while the royal visit is a coup for Ennismore, a chance meeting on the grounds proves even more momentous for Rosie.<br/>Victoria Bell, the Ennis’s young daughter, is desperately lonely. Though the children of the gentry seldom fraternize with locals, Lord Ennis arranges for Rosie to join in Victoria’s school lessons. For Rosie, the opportunity is exhilarating yet isolating. Victoria’s governess and aunt objects to teaching a peasant girl. The other servants resent Rosie’s escape from the drudgery of life below stairs. Bright, strong-willed Rosie finds herself caught between her own people and the rarefied air of Ennismore—especially as she grows closer to Victoria’s older brother, Valentine.<br/><br/>As they near womanhood, the girls’ friendship is interrupted. Victoria is bound for a coming out season in Dublin, and Rosie must support her family. But Ireland is changing too. The country’s struggle for Home Rule, the outbreak of the Great War, and a looming Easter rebellion in Dublin all herald a new era. Not even Ennismore can escape unscathed. And for Rosie, family loyalty, love, friendship, and patriotism will collide, leading her through heartbreak and loss in search of her own triumphant independence.",

Louise is still adjusting to her postwar role as a housewife when she discovers a necklace in a box at a secondhand shop. The box is marked with the name of a department store in Paris, and she is certain she has seen the necklace before when she worked with the Red Cross in Nazi-occupied Europe —and that it holds the key to the mysterious death of her friend Franny during the war.<br/><br/>Following the trail of clues to Paris, Louise seeks help from her former boss Ian, with whom she shares a romantic history. The necklace leads them to discover the dark history of Lévitan—a once-glamorous department store that served as a Nazi prison, and Helaine, a woman who was imprisoned there, torn apart from her husband when the Germans invaded France.<br/><br/>Louise races to find the connection between the necklace, the department store and Franny’s death. But nothing is as it seems, and there are forces determined to keep the truth buried forever. Inspired by the true story of Lévitan, Last Twilight in Paris is both a gripping mystery and an unforgettable story about sacrifice, resistance and the power of love to transcend in even the darkest hours.",

But before vows can be sworn to either, they must face the harsh reality of what is waiting for them on the opposite side of the isle, and on the continent across the sea.<br/><br/>When a meeting with the foreign king goes awry, Wren grows suspicious that a dark magic may have their every move being watched. Desperate to protect her loved ones, Wren must reluctantly scheme behind the backs of her allies-including her betrothed's. But when the Black Art senses he is being double-crossed by his intended, the result may prove to be more devastating than the war they face.<br/><br/>As battles grow bloodier, the shifter king's temper grows concerning, and the strings of Wren and Sin's newfound trust are plucked as both struggle not to slip into damaging past habits. With new threats emerging around every corner, it is more important than ever that these lovers keep their daggers aimed at their enemies... not at each other's throats.<br/><br/>Love is a savage magic, but it may just prove to be this couple's most destructive weapon yet.",

For its second season, they’ve chosen to spotlight the century-old Village Blend and its quirky crew of baristas. Shop manager and master roaster Clare Cosi is beyond thrilled, especially when her superb bulletproof coffee lands her a craft services contract for the production.<br/><br/>Madame, the eccentric octogenarian owner of the landmark shop, reveals an old kinship with the star of the show, comedian Jerry Sullivan. Now a Hollywood legend, Jerry frequented the Blend during his early years performing in Greenwich Village comedy clubs. But the past may hold more than nostalgia for Jerry. Suspicious accidents begin plaguing his shoot. Then a real bullet is fired from a stage gun, and Clare becomes convinced something sinister is afoot.<br/><br/>While Jerry’s production moves to exciting new locations, Clare keeps the coffee flowing—and her investigation going—even as a murderer lurks in the wings. But can she root out the rotten player in this Big Apple production before the lights go out on her?<br/><br/>Includes a stellar menu of surefire recipes!",

So she never imagined she would find herself at a racetrack at dawn. But her new home, Briar Hill Farm, is in trouble, and she and her boyfriend, Pete Morrison, are willing to do just about anything to save it. The one silver lining to Jules’s unexpected side job is Alex, her new boss. Easygoing and cheerful, Alex couldn’t be more different from Jules. But they share a passion for their horses and a fierce drive to succeed, and for the first time in her life, Jules has a true friend. She needs Alex right now, because Pete has been more distant than ever. Is he hiding something? And why is he spending so much time with a new friend down the street?<br/><br/>As Pete continues to flounder, Jules takes the reins. But is the right path for her the right path for Pete, too? And can she convince him that he will be okay without Briar Hill, if the legal case threatening their home doesn’t go their way? To move forward, Pete and Jules must learn that real courage means hanging on for dear life and knowing when to let go.",

The quest to find her sister’s killer draws her into a shadowy realm where nothing is as it seems, where good and evil wear the same treacherously seductive mask. She is soon faced with an even greater challenge: staying alive long enough to learn how to handle a power she had no idea she possessed—a gift that allows her to see beyond the world of man, into the dangerous realm of the Fae. . . .<br/><br/>As Mac delves deeper into the mystery of her sister’s death, her every move is shadowed by the dark, mysterious Jericho, a man with no past and only mockery for a future. As she begins to close in on the truth, the ruthless Vlane—an alpha Fae who makes sex an addiction for human women–closes in on her. And as the boundary between worlds begins to crumble, Mac’s true mission becomes clear: find the elusive Sinsar Dubh before someone else claims the all-powerful Dark Book—because whoever gets to it first holds nothing less than complete control of the very fabric of both worlds in their hands. . . .<br/><br/>Karen Marie Moning’s explosive Fever series continues<br/>DARKFEVER • BLOODFEVER • FAEFEVER • DREAMFEVER • SHADOWFEVER • ICED • BURNED • FEVERBORN • FEVERSONG • HIGH VOLTAGE • KINGDOM OF SHADOW AND LIGHT",

It is only the wisdom learned from the experiences that has been carefully extracted and illustrated into poetry, in the hope that his son will be better able to paint the masterpiece of his own life.<br/><br/>With a humble heart and vulnerable spirit, Coyne invites the world on a one hundred poem journey to remind his son, and all of us, that in a world full of differences, there is one universal similarity ― our shared humanity.",

Now comes a new milestone in this boldly imaginative author’s accomplished, resonant body of work. Set in a not-too-distant America, I Cheerfully Refuse is the tale of a bereaved and pursued musician embarking under sail on a sentient Lake Superior in search of his departed, deeply beloved, bookselling wife. Rainy, an endearing bear of an Orphean narrator, seeks refuge in the harbors, fogs and remote islands of the inland sea. Encountering lunatic storms and rising corpses from the warming depths, Rainy finds on land an increasingly desperate and illiterate people, a malignant billionaire ruling class, crumbled infrastructure and a lawless society. Amidst the Gulliver-like challenges of life at sea and no safe landings, Rainy is lifted by physical beauty, surprising humor, generous strangers, and an unexpected companion in a young girl who comes aboard. And as his innate guileless nature begins to make an inadvertent rebel of him, Rainy’s private quest for the love of his life grows into something wider and wilder, sweeping up friends and foes alike in his strengthening wake.<br/><br/>I Cheerfully Refuse epitomizes the “musical, sometimes magical and deeply satisfying kind of storytelling” (Los Angeles Times) for which Leif Enger is cherished. A rollicking narrative in the most evocative of settings, this latest novel is a symphony against despair and a rallying cry for the future.",
