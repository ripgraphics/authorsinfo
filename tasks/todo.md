# Task Checklist (tasks/todo.md)

Use this file for non-trivial work: write a checklist, define success, track progress, and document results.

## Plan Template

- [ ] Restate goal + acceptance criteria
- [ ] Locate existing implementation / patterns
- [ ] Design: minimal approach + key decisions
- [ ] Implement smallest safe slice
- [ ] Add/adjust tests
- [ ] Run verification (lint/tests/build/manual repro)
- [ ] Summarize changes + verification story
- [ ] Record lessons (if any) in `tasks/lessons.md`

## Working Notes

(Key constraints, invariants, decisions, discovered pitfalls — keep short.)

## Results

(What changed, where, how verified.)
